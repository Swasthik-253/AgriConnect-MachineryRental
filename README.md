# Agriconnect: Revolutionizing Farm Machinery Booking

**Abstract:**
Agriconnect is a revolutionary platform designed to optimize agricultural practices by combining AI-powered crop analysis and smart machinery rental services. The app leverages image processing technology and deep learning models like ResNet to identify crops from field images, helping farmers make informed decisions about their crops and manage resources more effectively. Agriconnect also enables farmers to easily book machinery suited to their specific crop needs, improving productivity, reducing waste, and optimizing resource usage. By combining cutting-edge technology with a user-friendly interface, Agriconnect aims to transform the agricultural industry and empower farmers worldwide.

**Introduction:**
Agriculture remains the backbone of many economies, but small farmers, especially in developing countries, often face challenges in accessing modern farming technology. Agriconnect seeks to bridge this gap by providing a mobile platform that connects farmers with a network of local machinery owners, making it easier to rent farm equipment and optimize crop production. The platform integrates AI/ML algorithms to analyze crop health and recommend the most suitable machinery, all through a simple mobile interface. By digitizing farm machinery rental and utilizing AI for crop identification, Agriconnect empowers farmers to increase productivity, reduce costs, and contribute to sustainable agriculture.

**Methodology:**
Farmer Registration and Login: Farmers register with essential details such as name, email, location, and password. Once registered, they can log in and access the app.
Crop Identification: Farmers upload images of their crops, which are processed using the ResNet model to identify the crop and its stage of development.
Machine Recommendations: Based on the identified crop, the app recommends suitable machinery available for rent.
Booking Process: Farmers select their desired equipment, submit a booking request, and receive a notification when their order is approved by the machine owner.
Order Management: The app allows farmers to view, track, and manage all their bookings, making it easier to coordinate machinery rental and usage.

**Proposed System:**
The system is designed with a user-friendly interface that streamlines the entire processâ€”from crop identification to machinery booking. Key components include:

**AI-Based Crop Identification:** Using deep learning models like ResNet18 for crop identification with high accuracy.
**Machine Rental System:** A digital platform for easy and efficient booking of farm machinery, including detailed information such as availability, rental rates, and locations.
**Data-Driven Recommendations:** The app offers intelligent recommendations based on crop type, farm size, and other factors to ensure the most suitable machinery is booked.
