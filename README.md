# Agriconnect: Revolutionizing Farm Machinery Booking

**Abstract**:
Agriconnect is a revolutionary platform designed to optimize agricultural practices by combining AI-powered crop analysis and smart machinery rental services. The app leverages image processing technology and deep learning models like ResNet to identify crops from field images, helping farmers make informed decisions about their crops and manage resources more effectively. Agriconnect also enables farmers to easily book machinery suited to their specific crop needs, improving productivity, reducing waste, and optimizing resource usage. By combining cutting-edge technology with a user-friendly interface, Agriconnect aims to transform the agricultural industry and empower farmers worldwide.

**Introduction:**
Agriculture remains the backbone of many economies, but small farmers, especially in developing countries, often face challenges in accessing modern farming technology. Agriconnect seeks to bridge this gap by providing a mobile platform that connects farmers with a network of local machinery owners, making it easier to rent farm equipment and optimize crop production. The platform integrates AI/ML algorithms to analyze crop health and recommend the most suitable machinery, all through a simple mobile interface. By digitizing farm machinery rental and utilizing AI for crop identification, Agriconnect empowers farmers to increase productivity, reduce costs, and contribute to sustainable agriculture.

**Literature Survey:**
Agriconnect utilizes the power of AI and machine learning (ML) to address key issues in modern farming. The ResNet deep learning model is used for crop identification, which helps farmers make better decisions about crop health, pest management, and resource allocation. The application also addresses the challenge of accessing agricultural machinery by offering a rental service, allowing farmers to book machines suited for their specific needs. Through research and previous case studies, itâ€™s clear that technology adoption in agriculture has the potential to revolutionize the industry and significantly improve productivity and sustainability.
